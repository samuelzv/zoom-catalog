# ZOOMcatalog Front-End challenging

## Instructions

1. Create a web application using Angular 2+ and Angular Material (If you do not have experience with Material, use other module to replace it) to create a very simple login, when I send the username “admin” and password “admin” the application must display a dashboard with header, menu, and content area; In the menu component there should be 3 options: “Users”, “Catalogs” and “Flyers”.

There are some considerations and behaviors:

When “Users” is clicked in the content area must display what this service response https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users 
When “Catalogs” is clicked in the content area must display a random image from this service https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/<RANDOM_PHOTO_ID>
When “Flyers” is clicked must display a popup with the text “Not implemented yet” and return to the login form.
The whole application should not be more than 1mb after compiling it
Use the best strategy to build this exercise. Do not waste time in design, we are going to focus in functionality and best practices of programming ;)
